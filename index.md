## How do we help fight COVID-19?

As COVID-19 is spreading in Austria we use freed up computer resources to help research in predicting protein structures. We use the [BOINC client](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/index.php) developed by the Berkley University and contribute to the [Rosetta@Home project](https://boinc.bakerlab.org/rosetta/).

## How can I help?

The [BOINC client](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/index.php) works on every PC no matter how slow. Even android phones can contribute to the research.

### Install BOINC

Download Link: [https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/download.php)

After installing the Software, BOINC will ask you to add a project. Search for Rosetta@Home in the list then click "add". Create an account for the project and then your PC will start downloading new tasks.
